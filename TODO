* add task
add a task 1 with an LOE
based on LOE, task has an ETA

** specify LOE with text
1w 3d = 1 week + 3 days
1w3d also okay
also understand y - year, m - month, h - hour

** calc ETA
add remaining LOE To current date to get ETA

* make task dependent
add another task 2 with an LOE
make task 1 dependent on task 2
see that task 1 ETA = task 1 Remaining LOE + task 2 Remaining LOE

** multiple dependencies

create database
add another task 3 with an LOE
make task 1 dependent on task 3
see that task 1 ETA = task 1 Remaining LOE + task 2 Remaining LOE + task 3 Remaining LOE

db list tasks
